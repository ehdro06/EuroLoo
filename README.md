# EuroLoo wc 🇪🇺

A privacy-first, community-driven public toilet finder for Europe. Powered by open data and modern web technologies.

## System Architecture

EuroLoo operates on a distributed, serverless architecture designed for rapid scaling and low maintenance overhead:

* **Frontend (Client):** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) deployed on **Vercel**. Handles SSR/SSG and edge routing.
* **Backend (API):** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) deployed on **Google Cloud Run**. Stateless, auto-scaling microVMs processing business logic and REST endpoints.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with **PostGIS** extension, hosted on **Neon** serverless database. Utilizes connection pooling (`pgbouncer`) for rapid container scaling.
* **Authentication:** [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) for identity management and JWT verification.
* **CI/CD:** Google Cloud Build automates the Docker pipeline from GitHub `main` branch directly to Cloud Run.
